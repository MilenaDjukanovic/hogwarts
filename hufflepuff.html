                    of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff is the
                    most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair
                    play rather than a particular aptitude in its members.

                    hard-working, friendly, loyal, honest and rather impartial. It may be that due to their values,
                    Hufflepuffs are not as competitive as the other houses, and are more modest about their
                    accomplishments. </p>

                    recognised his innocence, and objected strongly.
