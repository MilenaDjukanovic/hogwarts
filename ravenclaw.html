                    of Witchcraft
                    and Wizardry. The House was founded by Rowena Ravenclaw.

                    motivated and talented students. They also pride themselves
                    on being original in their ideas, and methods. It's not unusual
                    to find Ravenclaw students practising especially different
                    types of magic that other houses might shun.Ravenclaw House prizes learning, wisdom, wit, and
