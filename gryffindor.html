                <p class="harryPotterFont" style="color: white;">Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose
                    students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, and determination,
                    to be sorted into his house. The emblematic animal is a lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold.
                    Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick" is the House ghost.

                <p class="harryPotterFont" style="color: white;"> The Gryffindor house emphasises the traits of courage
                    as well as "daring, nerve, and chivalry," and thus its members are generally regarded as
                    brave, though sometimes to the point of recklessness. Some Gryffindors have also been noted to be
                    short-tempered. Notably, Gryffindor house contributed many members to Dumbledore's Army and the
                    Order of the Phoenix. </p>
