                    of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Salazar Slytherin. In establishing the house, Salazar
                    instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few particular characteristics he most valued.
                    Those characteristics include: cunning, resourcefulness, and ambition.</p>

                <p class="harryPotterFont" style="color: white;"> Many Slytherin students tend
                    to clique together, often acquiring leaders, which further exemplifies Slytherin's ambitious
                    qualities.The founder highly valued and favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat admitted
                    that it can be a factor when being Sorted.The emblematic animal of the house is a snake and its
                    colours are green and silver. </p>

                    Voldemort and take control of the Wizarding world by manipulating the festering relationship between
                    pureblood and Muggle-born wizards. Eventually he would lose all,brcause of his inability to love or trust anyone but himself.
                    As he told Quirrell, he believed that “there is no good and evil, there is
                    only power, and those too weak to seek it.”
